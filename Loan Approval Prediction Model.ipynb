    "### _Business Problem_\n",
    "Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that every retail bank faces in their lending operations. If the loan approval process is automated, it can save a lot of man hours and improve the speed of service to the customers. The increase in customer satisfaction and savings in operational costs are significant. However, the benefits can only be reaped if the bank has a robust model to accurately predict which customer's loan it should approve and which to reject, in order to minimize the risk of loan default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Translate Business Problem into Data Science / Machine Learning problem_\n",
    "This is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. Specifically, it is a binary classification problem where we have to predict either one of the two classes given i.e. approved (Y) or not approved (N). Another way to frame the problem is to predict whether the loan will likely to default or not, if it is likely to default, then the loan would not be approved, and vice versa. The dependent variable or target variable is the Loan_Status, while the rest are independent variable or features. We need to develop a model using the features to predict the target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Education - Applicants with higher education level i.e. graduate level should have higher chances of loan approval\n",
    "- Income: Applicants with higher income should have more chances of loan approval\n",
    "- Loan amount: If the loan amount is less, the chances of loan approval should be high\n",
    "- Loan term: Loans with shorter time period should have higher chances of approval\n",
    "- Previous credit history: Applicants who have repayed their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval\n",

    "After trying and testing 4 different algorithms, the best accuracy is achieved by Logistic Regression (0.7847), followed by RandomForest (0.7778) and XGBoost (0.7778), and Decision Tree performed the worst (0.6458). While new features created via feature engineering helped in predicting the target variable, it did not improve the overall model accuracy much. Compared to using default parameter values, GridSearchCV helped improved the model's mean validation accuracy by providing the optimized values for the model's hyperparameters. On the whole, a logistic regression classifier provides the best result in terms of accuracy for the given dataset, without any feature engineering needed. Because of its simplicity and the fact that it can be implemented relatively easy and quick, Logistic Regression is often a good baseline that data scientists can use to measure the performance of other more complex algorithms. In this case, however, a basic Logistic Regression has already outperformed other more complex algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, for the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestions for Improvement**. There are many things that can be tried to improve the models’ predictions.  We can create and add more variables, try different models with different subset of features and/or rows, etc. Some of the ideas are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine the applicants with 1,2,3 or more dependents and make a new feature as discussed in the EDA part.\n",
    "- Make independent vs independent variable visualizations to discover some more patterns.\n",
    "- Arrive at the EMI using a better formula which may include interest rates as well.\n",
    "- Try ensemble modeling (combination of different models). More about ensemble techniques can be found at the references.\n",
    "- Try neural network using Tensorflow or PyTorch\n",
